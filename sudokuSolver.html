            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>A Sudoku solver that uses backtracking to find a solution to any solvable game. Added functionality
                to play the game as well as manually input your own board.
            </p>

            <h4>The Solving Method</h4>
            <p>The solving method that I chose to implement uses backtracking. Backtracking is when you revert back to
                the previous step or solution as soon as it is determined that the current solution cannot be continued
                into a complete one. The algorithm starts by finding an empty spot on the board and attempts to put all
                numbers (1-9) in that spot. It then checks each number to see if it is possible to put it in that spot
                by seeing if there is already the same number in that row, column, or box. If a possible number is
                found, then put that number in the spot, and recursively attempt to fill the next empty spot of the
                board. If a possible number is not found, then backtrack to the previous spot, reset it, and continue to
                look for a different possible number. When there are no empty spots left on the board, then the
                algorithm arrives at the base case, and the board is solved.
            </p>

            <h4>How it was Built</h4>
            <p>For this project, I first built a text version in Python that takes a Suduko board, represented by a 2D
                list of integers, and prints a nicely formatted solved board to the terminal. I then decided that I
                wanted to create a GUI version using Pygame where the backtracking algorithm used to solve the board
                could be visualized. The algorithm used for the text version could also be applied to the GUI version
                and I simply modified and updated the board during different parts of the algorithm. For example, when a
                possible number is found for an empty cell, it gets filled with that number and a green outline. When
                there isn't a possible number for an empty cell and the algorithm backtracks, then the cell without any
                possibilities gets filled with an 'X' and a red outline. After implementing the solving visualization, I
                decided that I wanted to add functionality to play the game as well as manually input your own board.
                These both involve entering a number on the board, which can only be done when the number can possibly
                be put in the cell and the board can still be solved with the number in the cell.
